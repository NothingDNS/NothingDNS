# NothingDNS Security Audit — Final Report

**Target**: NothingDNS (Go DNS server with HTTP API, React dashboard, clustering)
**Scan date**: 2026-04-17
**Methodology**: 4-phase security-check pipeline (Recon → Hunt → Verify → Report) with 9 parallel specialist agents + manual source verification of top-severity claims
**Report files**: `security-report/architecture.md`, `dependency-audit.md`, nine `sc-*-results.md`, `verified-findings.md`, this file

---

## Executive summary

NothingDNS ships a lot of the right security posture for a DNS server: crypto/rand TXIDs, PBKDF2-SHA512 with 310 k iterations, timing-equalised login, a DNS pipeline with panic recovery, ACL / rate-limit / RPZ / blocklist layers, AES-256-GCM gossip encryption, TLS 1.3-only defaults, SameSite=Strict cookies, SHA-pinned GitHub Actions, and recent fixes for VULN-012 / 022 / 033 / 035 / 036. The DNS parser itself is notably hardened (compression-pointer depth limit, NSEC/SVCB bounds). The frontend posture is strong (SRI-pinned Swagger UI, HttpOnly cookies, no source maps, no `localStorage` JWT).

**However**, this audit surfaces a cluster of high-impact issues that group into four themes:

1. **Cluster protocol integrity is broken.** Raft RPC uses plain TCP + `encoding/gob` — zero encryption, zero authentication — despite both `CLAUDE.md` and `architecture.md` claiming AES-256-GCM. Gossip (which IS encrypted) lacks replay protection and AAD. An attacker with network access to port 7947 can forge cluster state.
2. **DNSSEC at rest and in-flight both have broken defenses.** The private-key store's encryption constructor allocates an all-zero AES-256 key and never copies the caller's key, so at-rest encryption is a silent no-op. The validator has no caps on signatures/DNSKEYs per response, making the resolver vulnerable to CVE-2023-50387 "KeyTrap"-class DoS.
3. **The recursive resolver is exploitable Kaminsky-style.** No bailiwick check on records cached from upstream responses. Combined with "nil ACL means allow-all recursion" by default, deployments without explicit ACL config are open resolvers with trivially poisonable caches.
4. **Deployment artifacts disagree with each other.** Helm chart drops all capabilities but doesn't add `NET_BIND_SERVICE` (port-53 bind fails as shipped); Helm generates the JWT signing key via Sprig `randAlphaNum` (math/rand, time-seeded — predictable); raw k8s Ingress exposes `/metrics` without auth; `deploy/production.yaml` ships placeholder secret literals that an operator could apply unmodified.

45 verified findings: **4 Critical**, **14 High**, **17 Medium**, **9 Low**. CVSS v3.1-style scoring below. Full per-finding evidence in `verified-findings.md`.

### Risk score

Qualitative: **MEDIUM-RISK** for cluster deployments — VULN-037 is partially mitigated (TLS available but not enforced by default; production must enable it). Single-node deployments are **LOW-RISK** with the remaining unresolved items being infrastructure-level (k8s manifests, compose). 10 issues fixed since initial audit.

## Remediation roadmap

Four phases. Each phase groups work that should ideally ship as one review cycle.

### Phase 1 — Emergency fixes (same-week)
Goal: close the integrity and confidentiality holes that have no workaround.
- ~~**VULN-038** (DNSSEC keystore zero-key)~~ — **FIXED** (`keystore.go:98` does defensive copy). Existing on-disk keys must be re-encrypted.
- **VULN-037** (Raft plaintext) + **VULN-048** (gob on untrusted network) — wrap Raft transport in TLS (minimum) or design a framed AEAD transport matching the gossip model. Stop sending gob over the wire. Tag CLAUDE.md and architecture.md to reflect reality. **UNRESOLVED — priority.**
- ~~**VULN-050** (production.yaml placeholder creds)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `9ed6b8a`; env-var references + startup refusal).
- ~~**VULN-042** (Helm NET_BIND_SERVICE)~~ — **FIXED** (values.yaml adds NET_BIND_SERVICE cap).
- ~~**VULN-043** (Helm weak JWT PRNG)~~ — **FIXED** (helm fails if no secret provided).
- ~~**VULN-039** (bailiwick)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `c3f24ee`; bailiwick enforcement added to `cacheResponse` and NS delegation).
- ~~**VULN-040** (KeyTrap caps)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `2ef1fa0`; `maxRRsetsValidated=32`, `maxNSECValidations=16`).
- ~~**VULN-044** (DoH 401)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `0ca861e`; DoH/DoWS/ODoH paths in bypass list).
- ~~**VULN-055** (rate-limit outside auth)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `1ea4ad9`; rate-limit check moved above auth decision).

### Phase 2 — Network-reachable DNS-specific risks (1–2 weeks)
Goal: make the DNS server safe to expose.
- ~~**VULN-039** (bailiwick)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `c3f24ee`).
- ~~**VULN-040** (KeyTrap caps)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `2ef1fa0`).
- ~~**VULN-041** (open-resolver default)~~ — **FIXED** (security_manager.go:122 creates deny-by-default ACL; line 127 logs startup warning).
- ~~**VULN-044** (DoH/DoWS/ODoH 401)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `0ca861e`).
- ~~**VULN-055** (API rate-limit outside auth branch)~~ — **FIXED** (commit `1ea4ad9`).
- **VULN-045**, **VULN-046** (gossip replay + AAD) — add sequence number in AAD; accept only monotonic sequence per sender; include sender/receiver ID in AAD. **UNRESOLVED.**
- ~~**VULN-059** (forwarder TXID)~~ — **FIXED** (handler calls `upstream.RandomTXID()` before forwarding).

### Phase 3 — Deployment hardening (2–4 weeks)
Goal: fix the shipping artifacts so operators fall into the pit of success.
- ~~**VULN-047** (Raft WAL parser)~~ — **FIXED** (`io.ReadFull` + 64MiB `cmdLen` cap in wal.go).
- ~~**VULN-049** (Raft conn-map empty-key)~~ — **FIXED** (keyed by `NodeID(addr)` in rpc.go).
- ~~**VULN-051** (compose resource limits)~~ — **FIXED** (pids_limit, memory 256m/64m, CPU 0.5/0.1 in docker-compose.yml).
- ~~**VULN-052** (raw k8s configmap has no auth)~~ — **FIXED** (auth_required: true added to configmap).
- ~~**VULN-053** (raw k8s no NetworkPolicy)~~ — **FIXED** (network-policy.yaml ships default-deny + explicit-allow).
- ~~**VULN-054** (raw k8s metrics Ingress)~~ — **FIXED** (/metrics removed from ingress, denied at level).
- ~~**VULN-056** (Dockerfile ca-certificates)~~ — **FIXED** (explicit `apk add ca-certificates` in builder stage).
- ~~**VULN-057** (Secure cookie / plaintext HTTP)~~ — **FIXED** (`Secure: r.TLS != nil` on all cookie setters).
- ~~**VULN-078** (.dockerignore)~~ — **FIXED** (dnssec-keys/, data/, zones/, *.db, cache.json excluded).

### Phase 4 — Incremental hardening (as capacity permits)
Goal: reduce residual risk and attack surface.
- ~~**VULN-058** (log injection)~~ — **FIXED** (formatText sanitizes all field values).
- ~~**VULN-060** (DO-bit in cache key)~~ — **FIXED** (MakeKey includes doBit; handler extracts from OPT TTL).
- **VULN-061** (NOTIFY TSIG) — enforce TSIG when configured.
- **VULN-062** (optional gossip crypto) — make cluster encryption mandatory.
- **VULN-063** (RRL) — implement RFC-style response-rate-limiting.
- **VULN-064** (RPZ post-cache) — apply response-IP policy BEFORE caching.
- **VULN-065** (ANY / amplification) — RFC 8482 HINFO to ANY; TC=1 over UDP for large amplifier types.
- **VULN-066** (on-disk gob) — replace with TLV + HMAC.
- ~~**VULN-067** (blocklist path traversal)~~ — **FIXED** (BaseDir confinement rejects paths outside allowed directory).
- **VULN-068** (username DoS) — charge IP-budget on all 401s.
- **VULN-069** (singleflight) — coalesce upstream lookups by (qname, qtype).
- **VULN-070** (operator RBAC scope) — elevate cache-flush/DNSSEC-keys to admin.
- ~~**VULN-071** (MaxBytesReader)~~ — **FIXED** (config PUT handlers now use `http.MaxBytesReader`).
- ~~**VULN-072** (CSP connect-src)~~ — **FIXED** (ws:/wss: removed from connect-src).
- **VULN-073..081** — cleanup sweep.

## What looks good (confirmed controls)

Worth keeping and defending against regression. The following controls were audited and found in good shape:

- Password hashing: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, 310k iterations, crypto/rand 16-byte salt, `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for hash comparison. Timing-equalised login with `dummyHash` prevents user enumeration on the happy path (VULN-017 is already closed).
- DNS parser (`internal/protocol/message.go`): compression-pointer depth limited to 5, forward-pointer rejection, NSEC/NSEC3/SVCB bounds checks, EDNS0 OPT placement enforced. No `unsafe.Pointer`, no `//go:linkname`, no `exec.Command`, no `math/rand` for TXIDs.
- HTTP server: all four timeouts (`ReadHeaderTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout`) set on both API and metrics servers.
- CSRF: cookie-auth only honored on safe methods; mutating requests require `Authorization: Bearer`. CSRF is structurally eliminated.
- Swagger UI: pinned `5.17.14` + dual `sha384` SRI hashes (VULN-012 fix verified correct).
- GitHub Actions: all third-party actions SHA-pinned; `permissions:` scoped per workflow; no `pull_request_target` + PR-head checkout; no shell-pipe installs.
- Dockerfile: multi-stage to `FROM scratch`, static binary with `-trimpath -ldflags '-s -w -extldflags -static'`, explicit `USER 1000`, labels in OCI-annotation format.
- Compose hardening (VULN-036 verified): `read_only: true`, `cap_drop: [ALL]` + `cap_add: [NET_BIND_SERVICE]`, `security_opt: no-new-privileges:true`, tmpfs for /tmp and /var/run.
- Kubernetes raw `deployment.yaml`: `runAsNonRoot`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `automountServiceAccountToken: false`.
- TLS 1.3-only defaults; `InsecureSkipVerify: true` only in tests.
- Audit log sanitization (`sanitizeLogField`) applied to user-tainted columns.
- DNS Cookies (RFC 7873) implementation is correct — HMAC-SHA256, rotation with 1-interval grace, 8-byte client cookie.
- AXFR default-deny when neither TSIG nor allow-list configured; DDNS requires TSIG.
- `$INCLUDE` blocks absolute paths, depth-limited to 10, symlinks rejected via `Lstat`.
- Bootstrap endpoint has localhost-only check + TOCTOU mutex (sc-auth).
- No `localStorage` JWT storage — only `{username, role}` survives a page reload; token is HttpOnly cookie.
- VULN-035 (production.yaml auth_required) is correctly applied.

## Methodology notes

- Phase 0: confirmed existing `security-report/` (11 files), user selected full rescan, directory cleaned.
- Phase 1 used a recon agent (`Explore`) for the architecture map and a `general-purpose` agent for the dependency audit. Both succeeded on first attempt.
- Phase 2 was initially attempted with `bug-analyzer` sub-agents. Those agents degraded into narration without executing tool calls (only `sc-crypto-secrets` and `sc-dns-specific` partially produced via `bug-analyzer` but with oversized outputs). All 9 specialists were re-launched as `general-purpose` agents with tighter prompts and explicit Write-tool instructions; all 9 completed and wrote their result files.
- Phase 3: the agent-based verifier similarly narrated without reading source (its "report" was fabricated — `verified-findings.md` was never written by the agent). The verification of top-severity claims was therefore performed manually by reading the cited source files directly (13 targeted reads), then the canonical `verified-findings.md` was authored from the nine Phase 2 reports plus the manual verification notes.
- Phase 4 (this document) synthesizes verified-findings.md into an operator-facing report.

Next steps for the team: triage VULN-037 and VULN-038 first; they're silent-failure integrity issues. VULN-039 through VULN-044 follow.
